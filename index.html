        <strong>I worked as a mechanic though high school and for a few years after I graduated. I opened a mechanic shop with my
            dad and worked with him for about 4 years. I left and went into steel construction and worked on commercial building
            and hung drywall for about 4 years. I then went on to build a few houses in the valley and did some TI work in
            some commercial building. Took a month and helped build a log cabin in Utah. I got tired of working out in the
            sun, so I went and got a degree and started working at Shasta Pools. Soon I was drawing all the pools for Mesa,
            Tempe, Ahwatukee, Chandler, Gilbert, San Tan valley, Tucson and Florence. I received a job offer at Titan for
            detailing formwork drawings and took it. I have been with Titan for 14 years now and enjoy working for this company.
            I have done AutoCAD drawings and some Engineering for this company. I have also largely developed the R&D department.
            I had Titan purchase a 3D printer and Solid works even did some testing of equipment out in the field. I have
            helped develop a CRM program over the last two years and feel coding and programing will be a good fit for me.
            I also do IT stuff for Titan. I am really looking forward to this next chapter.</strong>
